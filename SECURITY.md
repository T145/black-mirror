# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue in the project itself, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/T145/black-mirror/security/advisories/new) tab.

The project members will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the project members will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

To report a known security issue in one of the project dependencies, please open a regular project issue and/or submit a PR with the updated version of the impacted dependency.
