## ðŸ§  Philosophy

- Keep it 100% open-source.
> The "how it's made" is just as important as the final product. Many open-source blocklist projects I've seen don't have "how" made public.
> This project is open and flexible, so you can fork it and whitelist what you need for personalized application.
- Make it secure.
> This project takes on a firewall security mindset, which is basically block everything and whitelist what's needed.
> Obviously this list isn't a firewall, so it just blocks as much as possible.
> Please report any "false positives" in an issue.
> Be sure to set up client and network firewalls, as this is no substitute.
- Let it grow!
> Contribute any useful sources you can think of manually by editting the `sources.json` file directly on a fork and making a pull request,
> or by creating an issue and placing your recommendations there. Help The Blacklist reach `node_modules`-level heights!

## ðŸ§° Usage

##### dnsmasq

Many popular platforms such as OpenWRT, DDWRT, and Pihole use DNSmasq as their choice TCP powerhouse.
After inspecting many domain blocklists you'll inevitably run across a list in the `dnsmasq.conf` format.
This list doesn't support it because you can just place `addn-hosts=black_ipv{4-6}.txt` in the config or as a passed parameter and have it work properly.
I've tested this across all the mentioned platforms using `dig{6}` on a small sample size and had each host null-routed successfully.
[DNSmasq's man page](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) discusses this further, and [DDWRT's ad blocking wiki page](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ad_blocking) provides examples.

##### ubound

Similar to dnsmasq, but requires more manual configuration.
Use the `black_ipv{4-6}.txt` list(s), and rename the extracted file into a *.conf file.
[steffinstanley discusses how to apply blocklists](https://medium.com/@steffinstanly/unbound-dns-blocking-3567986a5735).

##### personaldnsfilter

Use the domain list.
