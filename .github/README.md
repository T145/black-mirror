## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

#### dnsmasq

Many popular platforms such as OpenWRT, DDWRT, and Pihole use DNSmasq as their choice TCP powerhouse. After inspecting many domain blocklists you'll inevitably run across a list in the `dnsmasq.conf` format. This list doesn't support it because you can just place `addn-hosts=black_ipv{4-6}.txt` in the config or as a passed parameter and have it work properly. If you're using the `RADVD` daemon, use the IPv6 list. Otherwise, use the IPv4 version even if you have IPv6 support set up. I've tested this across all the mentioned platforms using `dig{6}` on a small sample size and had each host null-routed successfully. [DNSmasq's man page](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) discusses this further, and [DDWRT's ad blocking wiki page](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ad_blocking) provides examples.

#### unbound

Similar to dnsmasq, but requires more manual configuration. Use the `black_ipv{4-6}.txt` list(s), and rename the extracted file into a \*.conf file. [Steffinstanly discusses how to apply blocklists](https://medium.com/@steffinstanly/unbound-dns-blocking-3567986a5735).

#### personalDNSfilter

Use the domain list.

#### Desktop OS Hosts File

Use both the IPv4 and IPv6 lists.
