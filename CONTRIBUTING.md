## How to Contribute to The Blacklist

### Do you have a source you'd like to add?
Join the discussion around sources under the "Discussions" tab!
Issues should be restricted for more critical subjects about how the core program works.

### Have you found a redundant source?
A redundant source would be any source that has its own entry in `sources.json` and is mostly or fully included in another list.
Obviously one or the other should be removed, so please make an issue detailing the conflicting sources.

### Do you have a host or some hosts to whitelist or blacklist?
Join the corresponding discussion and post 'em!

### Have you found a bug in the main program?
Please make an issue detailing the issue as thoroughly as possible.
