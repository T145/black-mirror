## How to Contribute to The Blacklist

### Do you have a source you'd like to add?
Join the discussion around sources under the "Discussions" tab! I'd prefer to the discussion around sources to be more casual, so you can be as active or inactive as preferred.
Issues should be restricted for more critical subjects about the core program works.

### Have you found a redundant source?
A redundant source would be any source that has its own entry in `sources.json` and is mostly or fully included in another list.
Obviously one or the other should be removed, so please make an issue detailing the conflicting sources.

### Do you have a host or some hosts to whitelist or blacklist?
Join the corresponding discussion and post 'em!

### Have you found a bug in the main program?
Please make an issue detailing the issue as thoroughly as possible.
